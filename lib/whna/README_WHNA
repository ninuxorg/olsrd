= OLSR Weighted HNA plugin =

Last update 03/07/2012

== Description ==

The aim of this plugin is to allow the announcement of HNA networks with an 
attached target ETX weight/metric. 

To preserve compatibility with legacy nodes, this is achieved by using a fake, 
nonexistent attached node which announces the specified HNA. The metric 
between the current node and the fake node is the target ETX.


+---+           _____                     +---+        +---+    _____
| N |---Tetx---<_HNA_>         ==>        | N |--Tetx--| F |---<_HNA_>
+---+                                     +---+        +---+

N = current node                     To reach the goal of announcing HNA with 
F = fake node                        weight Tetx, a fake node F connected to N 
Tetx = target ETX                    with metric Tetx is introduced
HNA = announced HNA


Internal packet injection is employed to achieve the goal.


== Status ==

 - the plugin works only for IPv4 and can announce only a single HNA network
 - the target HNA route is not injected into the routing table


== Configuration ==

LoadPlugin "olsrd_whna.so.0.1"
{
	PlParam "WHna4" "10.255.255.0 255.255.255.0"
	PlParam "WHnaTargetETX" "1.8"
	PlParam "WHnaFakeNodeAddress" "192.168.101.222"
}
